This is the first project! I'll create a basic recipe website using HTML skills. The site will have an index page linking to several recipe pages. I'll set up a GitHub repository, build out the HTML structure, and create recipe pages with headings, images, descriptions, ingredients, and steps. This project helps practice working with Git, linking files, and building structured HTML pages.
